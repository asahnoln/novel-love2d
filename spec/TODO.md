## Game
- [ ] We see choices buttons
- [ ] We don't see skippedLines
- [ ] We can click a choice and continue
- [ ] Stay with the given setting
- [ ] Show current character

When we see something it means that love2d takes it to graphics
When we click something it means that love2d registers input at the element and something happens
Continue means we make an input and it continues the game - we see next script element
